# Outdoor Adventures Trip Planner

In order to alleviate the process of submitting trips for each semester, this is a quick tool to list and save the trips in a format that is easy to handle via code.

This tool is entirely client side so it requires things to be stored in the local browser storage or saved as a file to later be modified.

This is my first AngularJS tool, so it shouldn't be used as a reference.
